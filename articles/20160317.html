      <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Hello again from TriDIYbio! I&#39;m sending this email to remind all you wonderful people that we will be having our regularly scheduled monthly group meeting this weekend on Sunday.</p>
<p>Also, I wanted to highlight that this meeting will be a little different as it will feature a critical discussion for all of us bio-hackers in the Triangle Area and in our group. What&#39;s the big news you ask? From the very beginning the mission of this group has been focused on enabling our members to learn about, contribute, and be a part of the exciting and ever-growing scientific DIY community by giving all of us a common hands-on public space to do so, as well as a community to support it.</p>
<p>I want to share with you just one bit of news this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We are VERY close to being able to fulfill that goal of having our own first public space!</strong> It will be a place to experiment, to explore, to learn, and develop--all at a very reasonable price--but the rest of the TriDIYbio board members and I would first like to discuss with you: 1.Whether or not this remains our group&#39;s unifying ultimate goal. and 2. What we can all do to help achieve it. Come on out to our meeting to learn more.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for that reason I want to <strong><em>encourage everyone who is on this list to come out and participate in our meeting this week.</em></strong> Come share your projects, ideas, or just plain enthusiasm for bio projects, and also come discuss the future of DIYbio in the Triangle area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Time</em>: 6:30 pm. Sunday March 20th</p>
<p><em>Location</em>: SplatSpace makerspace of Durham.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Check out our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Research-Triangle-BioCoders/events/229241303/">meetup</a> for details.</strong></p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
