Hi everyone,

Hello again from TriDIYbio! I'm sending this email to remind all you wonderful people that we will be having our regularly scheduled monthly group meeting this weekend on Sunday.

Also, I wanted to highlight that this meeting will be a little different as it will feature a critical discussion for all of us bio-hackers in the Triangle Area and in our group. What's the big news you ask? From the very beginning the mission of this group has been focused on enabling our members to learn about, contribute, and be a part of the exciting and ever-growing scientific DIY community by giving all of us a common hands-on public space to do so, as well as a community to support it.

I want to share with you just one bit of news this week:

* **We are VERY close to being able to fulfill that goal of having our own first public space!** It will be a place to experiment, to explore, to learn, and develop--all at a very reasonable price--but the rest of the TriDIYbio board members and I would first like to discuss with you: 1.Whether or not this remains our group's unifying ultimate goal. and 2. What we can all do to help achieve it. Come on out to our meeting to learn more.

So for that reason I want to **_encourage everyone who is on this list to come out and participate in our meeting this week._** Come share your projects, ideas, or just plain enthusiasm for bio projects, and also come discuss the future of DIYbio in the Triangle area.

> _Time_: 6:30 pm. Sunday March 20th
>
> _Location_: SplatSpace makerspace of Durham.

**Check out our [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Research-Triangle-BioCoders/events/229241303/) for details.**
